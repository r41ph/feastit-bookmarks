# Feast It Bookmarks Application

Technical task for the Front End opening at Feast It.

## Challenges

- ESLint and Prettier configuration.
- Create the validation it's been complicated as representing a URL in regex is difficult, so after testing several options I used a regex that I found online.
- Although submitting an unfinished application was allowed, I wanted to finish mine so I have spent more than the suggested 4h time on finishing it.

## Deployment

- I have deployed the application to Heroku. It can be found here: [https://feastitbookmarks.herokuapp.com/](https://feastitbookmarks.herokuapp.com/)
